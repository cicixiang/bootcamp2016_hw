			<h3>Hello and welcome to my website.</h2>
				<p class="intro">My name is Chengcheng Xiang, everyone calls me CiCi. I came from Beijing,China, and I’m currently a graduate student from Parsons School of Design for Design and Technology Program. I have a bachelor’s degree in Graphic Design from Massachusetts College of Art and Design. <br>
				I am enjoying interaction design, especially the UX/UI design. People find me to be an upbeat, self-motivated designer, and I would like to explore new things and make friends with everyone.
